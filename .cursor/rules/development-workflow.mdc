# MediaForge Development Workflow

This document outlines the recommended development workflow for MediaForge.

## Development Environment

- macOS development environment with Xcode
- Python with CairoSVG for asset generation
- Required dependencies:
  - Cairo library (`brew install cairo`)
  - Python packages: `pip install cairosvg pillow`

## Build Process

1. Open the project in Xcode (`MediaForge.xcodeproj`)
2. Resolve any dependency issues
3. Build the application (Product > Build)

## Deployment

1. Generate production app icon assets
2. Build the application for release
3. Package the application as a Mac app bundle
4. Test installation and basic functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

1. **Asset catalog warnings:**
   - Ensure all AppIcon slots are filled with appropriate size images
   - Verify that Contents.json references valid filenames

2. **Test failures:**
   - Check test target configuration
   - Verify framework linkage
   - Make sure tests are properly structured

3. **Permission issues:**
   - File access requires proper entitlements for disk access
   - Sandbox permissions may need configuration
