# MediaForge Testing Guide

The MediaForge project includes several testing components to ensure functionality works correctly.

## Manual Testing

The main manual testing facility is in [MediaForge/Tests/ManualTest.swift](mdc:MediaForge/Tests/ManualTest.swift). This provides simple utilities to test:

1. Disk detection
2. Disk permission handling
3. File transfer operations

To run manual tests, use the appropriate entry point from the main function.

## Unit Testing

XCTest-based unit tests are organized in the test targets:

- **MediaForgeTests**: For business logic and model testing
- **MediaForgeUITests**: For UI and integration testing

## Common Issues & Fixes

1. **Expressions are not allowed at the top level**:
   - In Swift files like ManualTest.swift, ensure expressions are inside a function scope
   - Use the `main()` function as entry point rather than top-level code

2. **No such module 'XCTest'**:
   - Make sure test files are in the correct test target
   - Check that XCTest framework is properly linked
